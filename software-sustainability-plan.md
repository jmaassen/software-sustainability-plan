Software Sustainability Plan
============================

Through the software developed within its projects, the Netherlands eScience
Center aims to achieve maximum impact, in the broadest sense of the word. From
this, it follows that re-use by others must not only be facilitated, but even
encouraged, such that the code that is developed within the project has a good
chance to live on past the project's end date. 

Naturally, there is a cost-benefit tradeoff to be made: not every piece of
software is expected to be re-used.

The following questions are meant to make transparent the expected
sustainability and impact of the software that is developed within our projects.
Note that engineers from the Netherlands eScience Center can help with
implementation during the course of the project. The questions are classified
into three groups: "minimum effort", "recommended practices", and "long term
aspects". Each group is covered in more detail below.

Minimum effort
--------------

From the start of the project,

1. will the software be available under a permissive license such as
   [Apache-2.0](https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0.html) (preferred),
   [MIT](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html), or
   [BSD](https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html)?
    - [ ] Yes
    - [ ] No (warrants explanation)
1. will the software be developed in a publicly accessible repository such
  as [GitHub](https://github.com/) (preferred),
  [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), or
  [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org)?
    - [ ] Yes
    - [ ] No (warrants explanation)
1. will the software use domain-relevant open protocols, standards, and file formats?
    - [ ] Yes
    - [ ] No (warrants explanation)
1. will you cite the software like you would cite a paper?
    - [ ] Yes
    - [ ] No (warrants explanation)


As soon as possible after the project starts,

1. will a persistent identifier such as [a DOI issued by Zenodo](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/) be added to the software?
    - [ ] Yes 
    - [ ] No (warrants explanation)
1. will documentation that explains what problem the software addresses be  prominently published?
    - [ ] Yes
    - [ ] No (warrants explanation)
1. will the documentation illustrate the software's intended usage with
  examples?
    - [ ] Yes
    - [ ] No (warrants explanation)

Recommended practices
---------------------

1. Will the software have its own entry in software repositories such as the Research
  Software Directory (https://software.esciencecenter.nl), KBLab
  (http://lab.kb.nl/), Biotools (https://bio.tools/), or an other relevant repository?
    - [ ] Yes
    - [ ] No (warrants explanation)
1. Will the software be put in package managers such as
  [PyPI](https://pypi.org/),
  [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/),
  [maven](https://search.maven.org/), or
  [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) (as applicable given the language of choice)?
    - [ ] Yes
    - [ ] No (warrants explanation)
1. For your software, will you fill in [this checklist](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/) or an equivalent one?
    - [ ] Yes
    - [ ] No (warrants explanation)
1. Will you prominently post the results from the abovementioned checklist, for example as a 'badge' in the README?
    - [ ] Yes
    - [ ] No (warrants explanation)

Long term aspects
-----------------

After the project ends,

1. what will be the package's [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor)?
1. how many external contributors will there be?
1. what funding/in-kind contributions will be available to maintain and support the package?
