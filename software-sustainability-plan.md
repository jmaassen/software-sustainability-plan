Software Sustainability Plan
============================

Through the software developed within its projects, the Netherlands eScience
Center aims to achieve maximum impact, in the broadest sense of the word. From
this, it follows that re-use by others must not only be facilitated, but even
encouraged, such that the code that is developed within the project has a good
chance to live on past the project's end date. 

Naturally, there is a cost-benefit tradeoff to be made: not every piece of
software is expected to be re-used.

The following questions are meant to make transparent the expected
sustainability and impact of the software that is developed within our projects.
Note that engineers from the Netherlands eScience Center can help with
implementation during the course of the project. The questions are classified
into three groups: "minimum effort", "recommended practices", and "long term
aspects". Each group is covered in more detail below.

Minimum effort
--------------

From the start of the project,

1. will the software be available under a permissive license such as
   [Apache-2.0](https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0.html) (preferred),
   [MIT](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html),
   [BSD](https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html) or 
   GPL?
    - [ ] Yes
    - [ ] No (warrants explanation)
1. will the software be developed in a publicly accessible repository such
  as [GitHub](https://github.com/) (preferred),
  [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), or
  [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org)?
    - [ ] Yes
    - [ ] No (warrants explanation)
1. will you adhere to the FORCE11 recommendations for citing software (https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.86; section _What software to cite_)?
    - [ ] Yes
    - [ ] No (warrants explanation)

As soon as possible after the project starts,

1. will a persistent identifier such as [a DOI issued by Zenodo](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/) be added to the software?
    - [ ] Yes 
    - [ ] No (warrants explanation)
1. will the software have its own entry in a software directory such as the Research
  Software Directory (https://software.esciencecenter.nl), KBLab
  (http://lab.kb.nl/), Biotools (https://bio.tools/), or an other relevant directory?
    - [ ] Yes
    - [ ] No (warrants explanation)
1. will the software have documentation targeting new users illustrating the
   software's intended usage?
    - [ ] Yes
    - [ ] No (warrants explanation)

Recommended practices
---------------------

1. For your software, will you fill in [this checklist](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/) or an equivalent one?

    _While more compliance is better, a 100% score is not usually expected._
    - [ ] Yes
    - [ ] No (warrants explanation)
1. Will you prominently post the results from the abovementioned checklist, for example as a 'badge' in the README?
    - [ ] Yes
    - [ ] No (warrants explanation)

Long term aspects
-----------------

1. What will you do _during the project_ to ensure that the software lives on 
   past the project's end date?
